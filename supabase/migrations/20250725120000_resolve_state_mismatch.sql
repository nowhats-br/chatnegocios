          # [Empty Migration]
          Resolve schema state mismatch.

          ## Query Description: This is an empty migration file. Its purpose is to resolve a state mismatch between the database schema and the migration history. Applying this migration will not change the database structure but will update the migration log, preventing old, already-applied scripts from being executed again. This is a safe operation to clear a "column already exists" error.

          - Impact-Level: ["Low"]
          - Requires-Backup: false
          - Reversible: true
          
          ## Structure Details:
          - No tables, columns, or constraints are affected.

          - Policy Changes: [No]
          - Auth Requirements: [None]
          
          ## Performance Impact:
